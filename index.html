                Where the powerful Atlantic waves meet Ireland's rugged western coast, the Wild Atlantic Way Road Trip with a Caravan (WAW) 
                is the world's longest defined coastal touring route. These suggested itineraries take you along the 2,500-kilometer length 
                of the Wild Atlantic Way, highlighting the best things to do, see, and stay along the way.<br>
                <br>
                The WAW begins at the tip of Donegal and winds its way along the western coastline to Cork, the country's southernmost point. 
                Unless you have a few months to drive the entire 2,500km, it is best to break it up into sections and return to do another 
                route later. This is not a trip to be taken lightly, and you should take time and take in the breathtaking scenery.

            <p>
                You are not required to follow these routes and are free to venture into other locations. 
                The best thing you can do is be adaptable and take your time exploring this wonderful country. 
                The Wild Atlantic Way is entire of adventure and excitement around every turn.<br>
                <br>
                Every Irish child's childhood vacation must include a trip to the beach. 
                A family vacation in Donegal and Sligo stands out for sandy beaches and secluded coves. 
                Younger children explore fairy bridges and rock pools, while older children enjoy horseback riding 
                on the seashore and finding hidden caverns. There are 1,134 kilometers of sandy beaches, cliffs, and 
                rugged inlets to explore in Donegal.

            <h3>Blue Ridge Mountains and RV campgrounds</h3>
            <address class="author">

                The Blue Ridge Mountains run from Georgia to Pennsylvania and are part of the Appalachian Mountains. 
                It is one of the oldest mountain ranges in the eastern United States and one of the country's most beautiful mountain ranges. 
                Because the range contains some of the most stunning sights east of the Mississippi River, it is a popular destination for 
                RVers, campers, and other explorers.<br>
                <br>

            <p>
                One of the most incredible ways to experience this area is to drive along the Blue Ridge Parkway. 
                The picturesque ribbon of road weaves its way through the mountain range's almost 470 miles. 
                It is a gorgeous and enjoyable drive that every American should take at least once. 
                The route is known as America's favorite drive for a good reason. It is one of those must-do road 
                excursions for any RVer, and it is on par with anything you will see on the coasts or in the West.<br>
                <br>
                Taking an RV trip through the Blue Ridge Mountains is simple and enjoyable. While you may travel the route in your car 
                if you are tent camping or staying in motels, anyone who has done so previously will tell you that now is the best time 
                to try RV travel. A few years ago, I drove this route and noticed several RVs. I should also mention that numerous 
                Blue Ridge Parkway or Blue Ridge Mountain campgrounds can accept RVs.
