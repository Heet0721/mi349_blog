            <h2>About Adventurous Traveller</h2>
            <p>
                The Adventurous Traveller is more than a website. We are a community of adrenaline enthusiasts who like to share wisdom 
                and experiences. We are here to help you to plan your next awesome holiday. We created this blog to share with you the 
                most beautiful and adventurous places and stunning holiday destinations which we visited during our travels. 
                We are REAL people, with REAL experiences to share. Any writers here are not simply hired guns from a content service; 
                they are genuine adventure junkies who can write! We want to see others succeed in this industry and experience the same 
                level of freedom that blogging has given us, which is why we're sharing the tried and tested strategies that we perfected 
                throughout our journey.
